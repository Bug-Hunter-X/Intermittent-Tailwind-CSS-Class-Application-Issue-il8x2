```javascript
// Ensure that your CSS is correctly imported and compiled, and that the Tailwind directives are properly configured within your project.
// Check for any conflicting CSS rules that may be overriding your Tailwind classes.
// Verify that the classes are correctly spelled and that there are no typos.
// Check for any issues with your CSS build process or that there are no issues with the Tailwind configuration.
// Check if the element is properly rendered and if the element is inside a context where Tailwind is applied (e.g. a component that correctly imports Tailwind).
// If you're using any component libraries, ensure that these libraries don't conflict with Tailwind's class application.
// Consider using the purge feature of Tailwind for production to remove unused classes. 

/* Example Solution: Verify class name and structure */
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
  <p>This text should have a red background and padding.</p>
